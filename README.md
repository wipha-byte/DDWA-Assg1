# DDWA-Assg1
Making a log in page and table. Lots and lots of databases. 
# **DDWA Assignment 1**

I created a Content Management System for IMGD Resource Library (IRL). It has 3 modes of access, each with varying levels of protection. This website makes it easier for both IMGD students and staff alike to view their data.

The database has been created from scratch and holds information about IMGD, of which selected info can be viewed by different parties.

**Design Process**

I want the website to be as convenient and simple so that everyone can use it without issue. So I keep the login interface uncluttered and clean. The website is a simple way for users to access data hassle free.

**Features**

**Existing Features**

- Feature 1 – Login from landing page as different users

**Technologies Used**

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
  - The project uses ready made bootstrap template as it is easier and makes the UI more bearable.

**Testing**

1. Student landing page:
  1. Select student account
  2. Write a student id (a number from 1 to 3) as username
  3. Enter the password &quot;student&quot;
  4. You can now view your own student data.
  5. Click on the hamburger menu at top right and click log out to log out

Bugs: Many buttons aren&#39;t usable, in the landing ages, only the logout buttons work.
